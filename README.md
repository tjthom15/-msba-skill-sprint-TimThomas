I am still very new at Python and these programs so I believe that the basics would be much easier to read. 
This repo demostrated many programs with real world applications and I believe that 
this would be a gooad start without having to use AI to understand everything. Finally, This program merges 
SQL type programs into python and I found that mildly interesting.
