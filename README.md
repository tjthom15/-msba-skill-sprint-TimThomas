What does this repo do in plain language?
This plots various parts of the economic conditions of China and the the United States in comparison to each other. 

o What would you need to change to use it for a real company?
I believe that this would need to be replicated and saved for each country that a business (Humana) might 
be working in. This can act as future predictor based on a previous understanding of the economic 
condition of different countries.
