I want to work in economic development and I started looking for the basic formats that would show this comaparison
through data. This Repo does a basic comparision to China and the USA. I believe that this would be a good perspective career 
choice with my economic background. 

![Economic Data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0035084-7248-4352-8720-6d8617972883)

I tried running it but they did not save the data in the orginal repo. I did throughly look through 
the data and got a good understanding of the basic analysis.
