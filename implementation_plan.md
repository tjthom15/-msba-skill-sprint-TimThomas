o What does this repo do in plain language?

This repo breaks down and shows the trends of two different countries (USA vs China). It gives 8 different 
models and comparies 8 different econ. Factors. 

o What would you need to change to use it for a real company?

The scale would need to increase and it would help if there was a way to automate the pulling of data from different 
locations to keep the data fresh. I believe that this would good for companies in a internation threater like Humana 
to maintain a comapetitive advantage and outlook across the country.
